## Maintenance

**Task:** Explain how you monitor your deployed app to make sure that everything is working as expected.

We monitor our app on Heroku using the Heroku Metrics section. This section displays specific analytics over the past 24 hours, such as memory usage and response time. The memory usage metric shows us how much memory the application uses at every minute over the last 24 hours. If the memory usage remains non-zero throughout the 24 hour period, this shows us that the application did not crash. The response time metric shows us every time a user visited the application in the last 24 hours.
